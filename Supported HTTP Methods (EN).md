# Supported HTTP Methods

Severity: Varies  
CVSS: N/A

## Affected Assets

CHANGE ME!

## Description

The HTTP protocol offers a number of methods or verbs that can be used to perform actions on the web server.

While GET and POST are by far the most common methods that are used to access information provided by a web server, HTTP allows several other (and somewhat less known) methods. Some of these can be used for nefarious purposes if the web server is misconfigured.

## Supporting Evidence

## Recommendation

* Ensure that only the required methods are allowed and that these methods are properly configured.
* Ensure that no workarounds are implemented to bypass security measures implemented by user-agents, frameworks, or web servers.
